    "# Portfolio Exercise: Upload a Package to PyPi\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook for own package. `distributions_tm1611` package already uploaded to PyPi, now create another package and upload it there as well. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "On a window machine, the commands are slightly different, use the command prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Comparison of MS-DOS vs Linux commands](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Step_by_Step_Guide/ap-doslinux.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have saved your work somewhere else (i.e. github) \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can connect to a remot GitHub repo from within the workspace terminal\n",
    " - [adding an existing repository to GitHub using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)\n",
    "- Another option: download files or folders  directly from the workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build python package and upload to PyPi\n",
    "- Use OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Package ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Series package\n",
    " - classify characteristics, properties of a time series and returns them\n",
    " - upload a series and apply algorithms\n",
    " - compare these algorithms wrt errors...\n",
    "- implement a simple algorithm (Support Vector Machine, etc.)\n",
    "- Package that implements algorithms such as Newton's method ...\n",
    "- Package that does basic matrix algebra operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reminders \n",
    "\n",
    "- include README file\n",
    "- comment your code\n",
    "- Refactor code when possible\n",
    "- Use OOP if it makes sense\n",
    "- Write unit tests\n",
    "- Use github fro version control, and commit your work often\n",
    "\n",
    "Package should be placed in a folder with the following subfolder and files:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can first upload to the test.pypi repo and if everything works as expected upload to the public facing pypi repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you also need to `pip install twine`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Possible Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two websites: Note that there is a test.pypi website and a pypi website\n",
    "- Unique Name: Name of the package must be unique.\n",
    "- Reuploading and versioning: You cannot upload the same version of a package again. \n",
    " - simply change the version number of your package, i.e. `version=0.1.1` to `version=0.1.2`is sufficient.\n",
    " \n",
    "What these version numbers mean, see this tutorial about [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) --> Standard for deciding when to move up to the next number in your versioning scheme.\n"
